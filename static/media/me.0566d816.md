## Backend and Blockchain developer based in Moldova

_In the past I was a molecular biology researcher, now Iâ€™m a blockchain developer._  
_Interested in machine learning, blockchain, bioinformatics and gamedev._

The main area of my expertise is backend (Node.js) and blockchain (Ethereum) development.  
My main language is JavaScript, but I have also experience with other languages in production like Python 3 and Golang.

As a blockchain developer, I have experience with Ethereum smart contract development (Solidity), deployment (Truffle), testing, integration (Web3) and audit.  
Also I had some experience with Binance-chain, Bitcoin and private Ethereum networks with custom protocols during the development of cross-chain exchange and multi-blockchain wallet solutions.

I have also experience with designing, building and maintaining infrastructure on AWS (EC2, Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, Lambda, ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront, etc.) using various technologies and tools (Docker, Terraform, Gitlab CI, GitHub Actions).
